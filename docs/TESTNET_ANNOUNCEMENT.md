### FAQ

**Q: Is testnet RNR worth anything?**
A: No, TEST-RNR has no monetary value. It's for testing only.

**Q: Will my testnet balance transfer to mainnet?**
A: No, mainnet will start fresh. Testnet is separate.

**Q: Can I mine on multiple machines?**
A: Yes! Run multiple nodes to increase your chances.

**Q: What happens if I find a bug?**
A: Report it via GitHub/Discord. Recognition for top contributors!

**Q: When is mainnet?**
A: After successful testnet (3-6 months). We won't rush it.

**Q: What hardware do I need?**
A: Minimum 4-core CPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD. More = better mining.

**Q: Can I run this on Windows?**
A: Yes! Download `rnr-node-windows.exe` instead.

**Q: Help! My node won't start!**
A: Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) or ask in Discord #support
